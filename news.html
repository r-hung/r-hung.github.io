		<h4 id="18-05-07">HUBS was listed in the 3-step "Exploring the Extreme Universe" strategic plan by CNSA (2018-05-07)</h4>
		<p>Recently, following the “Insight” satellite (“exploration”) and the “enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarization Observatory” (“detailed measurement”) under development, the “Hot Universe Baryon Surveyor (HUBS)” led by Tsinghua University was listed as the third step of the space science strategic plan for “Exploring the Extreme Universe” ("deep patrol").</p>

		<p>On the third session of the space science and deep space exploration forum held on the afternoon of May 5, 2018, Professor Wei Cui of the Department of Physics of Tsinghua University was invited to give a keynote report on HUBS. The forum was organized by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology (SAST) to discuss the overall research status and development prospects of space science. Under the guidance of the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the group company, SAST has established the Space Science Collaborative Innovation Center with 17 universities, including Tsinghua University, Peking University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Zhejiang University, etc., in order to accelerate the development of China's space science. </p>

		<p>Jian Zhao, Deputy Director of the Department of CNSA, Yuhong Li, Deputy Inspector of the Department of Science and Technology of the Ministry of Education, and Jianping Mei, Deputy Director of the Department of High-tech Development and Industrialization Division of the Ministry of Science and Technology, attended the meeting and delivered an important speech. In the speech, Director Zhao described the space science strategic plan including “Exploring the Extreme Universe” and stated that in the future, a number of new major space science projects will also be demonstrated and implemented to strengthen research on the basis of advanced space science and advanced technologies, as well as expand international cooperation in space science. At the same time, we must promote the innovation of institutional mechanisms, implement a system of chief scientists in space science projects, and implement an engineering construction responsibility system, actively plan cooperation in the field of space science with a global vision, and focus on enhancing innovation capabilities and international influence in strategic frontier areas. Representatives of Tsinghua University who attended the conference included Tipei Li, Academician of the Department of Physics, Yunfeng Gao, Director of the Military and Industry Department of the Scientific Research Institute, Junfeng Li, Party Secretary of the Aerospace Academy, and Shude Mao, Director of the Tsinghua Center for Astrophysics.</p>

		<h4 id="18-03-28">HUBS satellite project was incorporated into the CNSA’s Space Science Development Planning Guide (2018-03-28)</h4>
		<p>On the morning of March 28, 2018, the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology (SAST) visited the Physics Department and exchanged views on the Hot Universe Baryon Surveyor (HUBS) project undertaken by Prof. Wei Cui of the Physics Department. The conference was held in the conference room of Science Building B-315. Yunfeng Gao, Director of the Military and Industry Department of the Scientific Research Institute of Tsinghua University, Yayu Wang, Director of the Department of Physics of Tsinghua University, Tipei Li, Academician of the Department of Physics of Tsinghua University, Shude Mao, Director of the Tsinghua Center for Astrophysics, Baodong Fang, Deputy Director of the Research and Development Department of SAST, Wei Zhang, Deputy Chief Researcher of the Deep Space Exploration and Space Science General Research Office of SAST attended the meeting.</p>

		<p>At the meeting, Deputy Chief Researcher Wei Zhang gave a report on the domestic and international soft X-ray space astronomy projects. Professor Wei Cui introduced the scientific goals and background of the HUBS satellite project. Through discussion and communication, the participants believed that the engineering technology of the SAST was basically in conformity with the observation and technical requirements of the HUBS satellite project. Deputy Minister Baodong Fang introduced the scientific satellite R&D management system of SAST and expressed his hope of cooperation with Tsinghua University in the R&D of HUBS satellites. Academician Tipei Li believes that Tsinghua University and SAST have great room for cooperation in scientific satellite R&D.</p>

		<p>On the afternoon of March 29, 2018, Professor Wei Cui was invited by SAST to jointly communicate with Peng Liu, the System Project Director of the China National Space Administration (CNSA) about the HUBS satellite project. CNSA is very much in agreement with the scientific goals of the project and affirms its international leadership and international forefront. On April 4, 2018, HUBS satellite project was incorporated into the Space Science Development Planning Guide of CNSA, and it was used as a key project for the follow-up development.</p>

		<p>The HUBS satellite project fully responds to the national strategy. The State Council issued the "Actively Leading Organization of International Scientific Plans and Scientific Engineering Programs" to conduct research and development of the project. At the same time, it actively strengthens the communication and cooperation with the international space science field and enhances its international influence. It has become an internationally-advanced scientific satellite project.</p>

		<h4 id="17-12-30">HUBS was selected as the “Space Center (Phase 2)” Strategic Pilot Science and Technology Project (2017-12-30)</h4>
		<p>In December 2017, the "Hot Universe Baryon Surveyor" ("HUBS" satellite) project, chaired by Prof. Wei Cui of the Department of Physics, passed the selection of Strategic Pilot Science and Technology Project of the “Space Center (Phase 1)” of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and was formally selected as the "Space Center (Phase 2)" Strategic Pilot Science and Technology Project. At present, the project task report and budget estimate have been completed.</p>

		<p>The space science pre-research project is a preliminary study of the space science satellite program and necessary key technologies to be carried out in the next 5 to 15 years in China. It will comprehensively promote the research of innovative concepts, forward-looking technologies, and key technologies in the field of space science, laying the foundation for long-term sustainable development of space science.</p>

		<p>In April 2017, the conceptual proposal of the HUBS space science mission presented by Prof. Wei Cui passed the project selection of the National Space Science Center of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and entered the research stage. At the first HUBS Collaboration Meeting held in Tsinghua University in July 2017, the satellite’s scientific goals and design indicators were identified and a core technical cooperation team was initially formed, including the Netherlands Institute of Space Research (SRON), Tongji University, Institute of Physics and Chemistry, CAS (IPC), and Shanghai Institution of Microsystem and Information Technology (SIMIT). The main scientific goal of the HUBS satellite project is to reveal the mystery of "missing cosmic baryons" and to promote the theory of galaxy formation and evolution. In addition, HUBS satellites are also expected to have a strong boost in many other areas of X-ray astronomy.</p>
