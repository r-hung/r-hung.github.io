		<h4 id="18-05-18">Zhao Jian, Deputy Director of the Department of Systems of CNSA, led a team to visit Tsinghua University (2018-05-18)</h4>
		<p>On the morning of May 18, 2018, Jian Zhao, Deputy Director of the Department of Systems of the China National Space Administration (CNSA), visited Tsinghua University and jointly with the Vice President of Tsinghua University, Zheng You, to listen to the work report of the Hot Universe Baryon Surveyor (HUBS). Yan Wang, Vice President of the Research Institute of Tsinghua University and Baodong Fang, Deputy Minister of Research and Development of the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology (SAST) co-chaired the meeting.</p>

		<p>At the meeting, Academician Tipei Li of Tsinghua University introduced the background of the HUBS satellite project, and pointed out the significance for universities in China of participating scientific satellite research project from the perspective of the national development strategy. Professor Wei Cui of the Department of Physics and Wei Zhang, Deputy Chief Researcher of the Deep Space Exploration and Space Science General Research Office of SAST, respectively gave a scientific demonstration and technical demonstration report of the HUBS satellite project. Director Jian Zhao suggested that the HUBS satellite project, as the third step of the space science strategic plan for “Exploring the Extreme Universe” after the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT satellite) and enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarization Observatory (eXTP satellite), should adhere to the principle of “we take the initiative” and at the same time combine international cooperation to enhance China’s research capacity and discourse power in the international space field. Vice President You Zheng believes that the HUBS satellite project will combine the advantages of Tsinghua University in science and engineering to further promote the development of the physical and astrophysics disciplines of the university, and that Tsinghua University will fully support the cooperation with SAST and promote further research on the HUBS satellite project. Next, the HUBS satellite project will focus on scientific and technical demonstrations, accelerate the deepening of key technologies, and strive to establish projects in 2019.</p>

		<br>

		<h4 id="18-05-07">HUBS was listed in the 3-step "Exploring the Extreme Universe" strategic plan by CNSA (2018-05-07)</h4>
		<p>Recently, following the “Insight” satellite (“exploration”) and the “enhanced X-ray Timing and Polarization Observatory” (“detailed measurement”) under development, the “Hot Universe Baryon Surveyor (HUBS)” led by Tsinghua University was listed as the third step of the space science strategic plan for “Exploring the Extreme Universe” ("deep patrol").</p>

		<p>On the third session of the space science and deep space exploration forum held on the afternoon of May 5, 2018, Professor Wei Cui of the Department of Physics of Tsinghua University was invited to give a keynote report on HUBS. The forum was organized by the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology (SAST) to discuss the overall research status and development prospects of space science. Under the guidance of the China National Space Administration (CNSA) and the group company, SAST has established the Space Science Collaborative Innovation Center with 17 universities, including Tsinghua University, Peking University, Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Zhejiang University, etc., in order to accelerate the development of China's space science. </p>

		<p>Jian Zhao, Deputy Director of the Department of CNSA, Yuhong Li, Deputy Inspector of the Department of Science and Technology of the Ministry of Education, and Jianping Mei, Deputy Director of the Department of High-tech Development and Industrialization Division of the Ministry of Science and Technology, attended the meeting and delivered an important speech. In the speech, Director Zhao described the space science strategic plan including “Exploring the Extreme Universe” and stated that in the future, a number of new major space science projects will also be demonstrated and implemented to strengthen research on the basis of advanced space science and advanced technologies, as well as expand international cooperation in space science. At the same time, we must promote the innovation of institutional mechanisms, implement a system of chief scientists in space science projects, and implement an engineering construction responsibility system, actively plan cooperation in the field of space science with a global vision, and focus on enhancing innovation capabilities and international influence in strategic frontier areas. Representatives of Tsinghua University who attended the conference included Tipei Li, Academician of the Department of Physics, Yunfeng Gao, Director of the Military and Industry Department of the Scientific Research Institute, Junfeng Li, Party Secretary of the Aerospace Academy, and Shude Mao, Director of the Tsinghua Center for Astrophysics.</p>
        
        <br>

		<h4 id="18-03-28">HUBS satellite project was incorporated into the CNSA’s Space Science Development Planning Guide (2018-03-28)</h4>
		<p>On the morning of March 28, 2018, the Shanghai Academy of Spaceflight Technology (SAST) visited the Physics Department and exchanged views on the Hot Universe Baryon Surveyor (HUBS) project undertaken by Prof. Wei Cui of the Physics Department. The conference was held in the conference room of Science Building B-315. Yunfeng Gao, Director of the Military and Industry Department of the Scientific Research Institute of Tsinghua University, Yayu Wang, Director of the Department of Physics of Tsinghua University, Tipei Li, Academician of the Department of Physics of Tsinghua University, Shude Mao, Director of the Tsinghua Center for Astrophysics, Baodong Fang, Deputy Director of the Research and Development Department of SAST, Wei Zhang, Deputy Chief Researcher of the Deep Space Exploration and Space Science General Research Office of SAST attended the meeting.</p>

		<p>At the meeting, Deputy Chief Researcher Wei Zhang gave a report on the domestic and international soft X-ray space astronomy projects. Professor Wei Cui introduced the scientific goals and background of the HUBS satellite project. Through discussion and communication, the participants believed that the engineering technology of the SAST was basically in conformity with the observation and technical requirements of the HUBS satellite project. Deputy Minister Baodong Fang introduced the scientific satellite R&D management system of SAST and expressed his hope of cooperation with Tsinghua University in the R&D of HUBS satellites. Academician Tipei Li believes that Tsinghua University and SAST have great room for cooperation in scientific satellite R&D.</p>

		<p>On the afternoon of March 29, 2018, Professor Wei Cui was invited by SAST to jointly communicate with Peng Liu, the System Project Director of the China National Space Administration (CNSA) about the HUBS satellite project. CNSA is very much in agreement with the scientific goals of the project and affirms its international leadership and international forefront. On April 4, 2018, HUBS satellite project was incorporated into the Space Science Development Planning Guide of CNSA, and it was used as a key project for the follow-up development.</p>

		<p>The HUBS satellite project fully responds to the national strategy. The State Council issued the "Actively Leading Organization of International Scientific Plans and Scientific Engineering Programs" to conduct research and development of the project. At the same time, it actively strengthens the communication and cooperation with the international space science field and enhances its international influence. It has become an internationally-advanced scientific satellite project.</p>
